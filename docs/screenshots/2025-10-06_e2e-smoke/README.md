# Automated E2E screenshots

Playwright saves full-page screenshots for the offline smoke scenario in this folder.

Screenshots are generated by running:

```
npm --prefix frontend run test:e2e
```

The suite captures each major phase of the workflow:

1. Default Titanic preview on first load (`01_home.png`).
2. Post-upload dataset refresh (`02_dataset_uploaded.png`).
3. Histogram preview (`03_histogram.png`).
4. Scatter plot (`04_scatter.png`).
5. Training kick-off (`05_training-start.png`).
6. Training completion summary (`06_training-complete.png`).
7. Evaluation overview (`07_evaluation.png`).
8. Confusion matrix detail (`08_confusion-matrix.png`).

Images are regenerated on every run and should not be edited manually.
